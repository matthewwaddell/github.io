<P>
    When i first applied here to UMaine, I applied as a KPE major which remained my major for the whole first semester.
    Through takingeclasses for kpe and pysical education I quickly found that this wasn't what I wanted to be doing.
    At the time it was frustrating because i had to remain in a major for the rest of the semester and take classes I
    didnt like, which showed to be a challenge but i still ended the semester stronger than i though i would have. After
    realizing I wanted a new major I business was the first thing that came to mind. I"ve always been interested in
    economics and enjoyed the business classes i took in highschool so it was an easy decsion to switch to business
    undelcared over this past break. I chose undelcared because although I am interested in economics, there are a lot
    of other topics of study that i want to become more well versed on before chosing a specific major and im looking
    forward in doing so
