<h2>College Life</h2>
So far in college i've thouroughly enjoyed my experience. I've met many new friends and gotten involved in activites
aroujd campus.One of my favorite things to do on here in my free time is partcipate in intramural basketball. I played
basketball throughout my life and enjoy being able to play still in my free time. I've also joined theta chi fraternity
here at Maine this first semester and it has been a great experience for me. I'm very glad to be apart of the brother
hood and have met some of my closest friends on campus through joining here.
One of my favorite things so far here have been the univiersty of Maine itself. (click for link) <a href="https://umaine.edu">here</a>.
I was very close to not coming here but am very glad I did as i now couldn't imagine myself going anywhere else.
One of the best parts about this school and campus for me has been the people and the scenery around campus. I've
grown to really like the state of Maine by going to places like acadia and just disovering more of <b>Maine</b>
On this <B>Web Page</B> I will show you different things about me.
