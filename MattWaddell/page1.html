<h1>WELCOME TO MATTS WEBSITE</h1>

<p><h2>Home Page</h2></p>

<p>Welcome to my website for BUA 235, where you will learn more about me and my life. My name Matt Waddell and I'm from a
    town in southern Connecticut called Brookfield, about an hour and a half outside <b>New York City<b/>.
        I chose to come to the University of Maine over many Connectciut in state schools because I wanted something
        different and i've been very happy with my decision. My major is currently business undelcared and i look on narrowing
        that down to a specific major in taking business classes like these this semester. I look forward to showing you more
        about me and my life on my website.<p/>
