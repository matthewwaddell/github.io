<P><h2>Life In Highschool</h2></P>

<P>W, In high school, sports were a big part of my life. I played lacrosse my first two years of High school and basketball
    all four years where i was the captain my senior year. Growing up I've liked all sports but basketball has always
    been the most important tome and I've been playing it nearly my whole life. I spent a lot of time  in and out of season working in basketball
    and it was always something i enjoyed doing. One of my best experiences out of basketball was the friendships ive gotten from it and
    I've met some of my closest freinds over the years through it. In highschool i was also involed with clubs in
    addition to sports that i enjoyed. I was apart of Key club which is part of kiwanis international and is essentially a club for community
    service and helping with school and community events. I did key club with other close friends and it was alwasy fun
    to be able to hangout with them and still be doing something good for the community. While i enjoyed my time at
    High school, I'm glad to be moved on from there and to the next chapter in college and even after.</P>
